[00:28.73] Baby, we were makin' straight A's
[00:32.30] But we was stuck in them dumb days
[00:35.48] Don't take much time to memorize your lies
[00:38.97] I feel like I've been hypnoticized
[00:55.97] 
[00:42.15] And then, the magic man, he come to town
[00:45.60] But he done spun my head around
[00:48.83] He said, "Recess is in session"
[00:50.94] "Two and two make five."

[00:56.39] Oh yeah! I am alive
[01:05.89] 
[00:59.48] And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
[01:03.40] Baby, you just better forget
[01:06.19] 'Cause rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme

[01:27.86] 
[01:20.54] Oh, you know, I was on the Honor Roll
[01:23.99] Got good grades, ain't got no soul
[01:27.89] Raise my hand 'fore I can speak my mind
[01:31.63] I've been biting my tongue too many times
[01:52.13] 
[01:34.70] And then, the magic man took to obey
[01:37.66] Now, do what magic man do, not what magic man say
[01:41.69] Now, can I please have the attention of the class?
[01:45.37] Today's ass-ignment, you know what it is, uh-huh
